## Stage 1: Mistake Recognition

### Scenario 1.1: Simple Mistake
**User:** "I just realized I missed my doctor's appointment this morning. I completely forgot about it."

**Expected Detection:**
- Stage: 1 (Mistake)
- Severity: mild
- Indicators: "missed", "forgot"

**Response Should:**
- Normalize the experience
- Focus on practical solutions
- Avoid judgment language
- Acknowledge ADHD executive function challenges

**Example Response:**
"I hear that you missed an appointment you had scheduled. That's frustrating, and it happens to many of us with ADHD - our brains sometimes struggle with time awareness and working memory. 

What matters most to you right now - rescheduling the appointment or figuring out a reminder system that works better for your brain?"

### Scenario 1.2: Work-Related Mistake
**User:** "I sent that email to the wrong person. It had confidential information in it."

**Expected Detection:**
- Stage: 1 (Mistake)
- Severity: moderate (due to consequences)
- Indicators: "sent... wrong"

**Response Should:**
- Acknowledge the stress without amplifying it
- Focus on damage control
- Prevent spiral to self-judgment

## Stage 2: Self-Judgment

### Scenario 2.1: Harsh Self-Talk
**User:** "I'm such an idiot. How could I forget my own child's school event? What kind of parent does that?"

**Expected Detection:**
- Stage: 2 (Self-Judgment)
- Severity: high
- Indicators: "I'm such an idiot", "What kind of parent"

**Response Should:**
- Reflect the pain without reinforcing negative labels
- Use perspective shift technique
- Separate action from identity

**Example Response:**
"I can hear how much this hurts - missing your child's event when you care so deeply about being there for them. Your inner critic is being incredibly harsh right now.

What would you say to another parent with ADHD who forgot an event? I imagine you'd show them much more compassion than you're giving yourself."

### Scenario 2.2: Professional Self-Judgment
**User:** "That presentation was pathetic. Everyone must think I'm incompetent. I made such a fool of myself."

**Expected Detection:**
- Stage: 2 (Self-Judgment)
- Severity: moderate
- Indicators: "pathetic", "incompetent", "fool"

**Response Should:**
- Challenge mind-reading assumptions gently
- Focus on actual evidence vs. fears
- Normalize presentation anxiety with ADHD

## Stage 3: Generalization

### Scenario 3.1: Always/Never Thinking
**User:** "I always mess everything up. This is just typical me - I can never do anything right. Story of my life."

**Expected Detection:**
- Stage: 3 (Generalization)
- Severity: high
- Indicators: "always", "never", "typical me", "story of my life"

**Response Should:**
- Gently question absolute statements
- Invite curiosity about exceptions
- Avoid directly contradicting

**Example Response:**
"I hear you saying this 'always' happens, and it sounds like you're seeing a pattern that feels really defeating. That must be exhausting to carry around.

I'm curious - can you think of even one small thing you did well this week? Sometimes our RSD brain highlights all the mistakes and hides the wins from us."

### Scenario 3.2: Pattern Recognition
**User:** "Every time I try to get organized, I fail. I always start strong but never follow through. It's the ADHD pattern of my whole life."

**Expected Detection:**
- Stage: 3 (Generalization)
- Severity: moderate
- Indicators: "every time", "always", "never", "pattern"

**Response Should:**
- Validate the frustration with ADHD patterns
- Reframe as neurological difference, not failure
- Explore what "organized" means to them

## Stage 4: Identity Attack

### Scenario 4.1: Core Identity Crisis
**User:** "Why am I such a failure? I'm 35 and still can't manage basic adult tasks. I'm broken. There's something fundamentally wrong with me."

**Expected Detection:**
- Stage: 4 (Identity Attack)
- Severity: severe
- Indicators: "I'm a failure", "I'm broken", "fundamentally wrong with me"

**Response Should:**
- Create immediate separation between actions and identity
- Validate intense feelings
- Introduce self-compassion
- Possibly suggest grounding

**Example Response:**
"I'm hearing a single difficult moment making you question your entire worth as a person. That must feel absolutely crushing. 

Let's pause for a moment - you are not your ADHD struggles. You're a whole person dealing with a neurodivergent brain in a world built for neurotypical processing. What if we separate what's hard for you from who you are?"

### Scenario 4.2: Relationship Identity Attack
**User:** "I'm a terrible partner. My ADHD ruins every relationship. No wonder people leave me. I'm just not capable of being loved."

**Expected Detection:**
- Stage: 4 (Identity Attack)
- Severity: severe
- Indicators: "terrible partner", "ruins every", "not capable of being loved"

**Response Should:**
- Address attachment fears with compassion
- Separate ADHD challenges from lovability
- Avoid toxic positivity

---

## Stage 5: Worthlessness

### Scenario 5.1: Crisis Level
**User:** "What's the point? I'm worthless. I just make everyone's life harder. They'd all be better off without me."

**Expected Detection:**
- Stage: 5 (Worthlessness)
- Severity: critical
- Indicators: "worthless", "what's the point", "better off without me"

**Response Should:**
- Prioritize safety
- Immediate validation and grounding
- Suggest crisis resources
- No questioning techniques at this stage

**Example Response:**
"I can hear how much pain you're in right now. These feelings are so heavy, and I want you to know that your worth isn't determined by your struggles.

You matter, and these intense feelings won't last forever. Would you like to try a grounding exercise together right now? Just something to help your nervous system feel a bit safer?"

### Scenario 5.2: Existential Despair
**User:** "I don't matter. Nothing I do matters. I'm just a burden taking up space."

**Expected Detection:**
- Stage: 5 (Worthlessness)
- Severity: critical
- Indicators: "don't matter", "burden", "taking up space"

**Response Should:**
- Gentle affirmation of inherent worth
- Offer immediate support tools
- Consider emergency resources

## Complex Scenarios

### Mixed Stages
**User:** "I forgot to pay the bills AGAIN. I'm so stupid. This always happens. Why am I such a useless adult? I can't even handle basic responsibilities."

**Expected Detection:**
- Stages: 1, 2, 3, 4 (rapid spiral)
- Severity: high
- Multiple indicators across stages

**Response Should:**
- Address the highest stage (4)
- Slow down the spiral
- Offer immediate intervention

### Previous Context Matters
**User:** (After discussing work stress) "And now I've messed up dinner too. Typical."

**Expected Detection:**
- Stage: 3 (Generalization)
- Severity: moderate (but consider cumulative stress)
- Context: Already vulnerable from work discussion

**Response Should:**
- Acknowledge cumulative stress
- Prevent further spiral
- Suggest self-care break

## Testing Notes

1. **Response Timing:** Helen should respond quickly to higher stages (4-5) to interrupt the spiral

3. **One Question Rule:** Maximum one open-ended question per response to avoid overwhelming

4. **ADHD Validation:** Every response should include some form of ADHD understanding

6. **Intervention Suggestions:** Based on severity:
   - Mild: Continue conversation with MI techniques

   - High: Offer specific RSD interventions
   - Critical: Immediate safety and grounding

## Success Indicators

- User de-escalates from higher to lower stages
