# Helen - ADHD Crisis Support App Overview

**Created by SepiidAI** | Version 0.0.0

Helen is an AI-powered crisis intervention and emotional support application specifically designed for individuals with ADHD. The app provides evidence-based therapeutic support through a calming, stress-ball-like interface that adapts to ADHD attention patterns and emotional intensity, with specialized support for Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD).

## üéØ Core Mission

Helen addresses the unique challenges ADHD individuals face during emotional overwhelm, providing immediate, accessible crisis support that works *with* ADHD brains rather than against them. The app combines ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy), and Motivational Interviewing techniques in an ADHD-adapted framework, with specialized interventions for RSD episodes.

---

**Helen represents a breakthrough in ADHD-specific crisis support technology**, combining evidence-based therapeutic approaches with cutting-edge AI orchestration. The app's sophisticated understanding of ADHD neurology - including attention patterns, emotional intensity, and rejection sensitivity - creates a genuinely adaptive support system.

**The core innovation lies in Helen's ability to work *with* ADHD brains rather than against them.** Through intelligent attention monitoring, micro-session management, and RSD-aware interventions, Helen provides immediate, accessible crisis support that adapts in real-time to user needs. The app serves as both an immediate crisis intervention tool and a long-term emotional regulation training platform, helping users develop skills while providing support exactly when and how they need it.

**Helen's success stems from its deep neurological understanding of ADHD.** The app recognizes that ADHD brains experience rejection more intensely, have variable attention spans, and require different emotional regulation strategies. Rather than treating these as deficits to overcome, Helen treats them as neurological differences to accommodate and work with.

**Technical Excellence Meets Therapeutic Innovation:** Helen's advanced AI orchestration - including attention fade detection, therapeutic rupture repair, and RSD-aware processing - creates a genuinely intelligent therapeutic companion that adapts moment-by-moment to user needs. Combined with privacy-first local storage and evidence-based interventions, Helen represents the future of accessible, personalized mental health support.
